# Generative AI-Powered Tool for Personalized Assistance  

This project develops a Generative AI-powered tool tailored to a specific domain, leveraging the **Dockerfile** dataset from Hugging Face's `bigcode/the-stack-v2` repository. The tool enables users to input queries, generate contextually relevant responses, and configure settings like tone or style. This README provides a step-by-step guide for dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, application development, deployment, and usage.

## Project Overview  

The main objective is to create a domain-specific AI tool for personalized assistance, using Dockerfiles as a dataset example. The solution involves:  

- **Dataset Preparation**: Preprocessing and augmenting the dataset with relevant context.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Customizing a pre-trained language model using the cleaned dataset.  
- **Application Development**: Building a user-friendly web interface with query input, real-time AI responses, and configurable settings.  
- **Deployment**: Containerizing and deploying the application to a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility.

## Dataset Preparation  

### Loading the Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is the **Dockerfile** dataset from Hugging Face. It includes a variety of Dockerfiles useful for domain-specific training.  

#### Code to Load the Dataset  

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds_dockerfile = load_dataset("bigcode/the-stack-v2", "Dockerfile", split="train")
print("Dataset Columns:", ds_dockerfile.column_names)

## Preprocessing the Dataset
Preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean and tokenized for model training. The focus is on the content_id column, which contains the Dockerfile data.

Steps:
Remove comments and extra whitespace.
Tokenize the content into manageable text blocks.
    
> Preprocessing Code
    
import re
def preprocess_code(sample):
    content_id = sample.get('content_id', '')
    if not content_id:
        print("Skipping sample due to missing 'content_id':", sample)
        return sample
    
    content_id = re.sub(r'#.*', '', content_id)
    content_id = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', content_id).strip()
    tokens = content_id.split()
    sample['content_id'] = ' '.join(tokens)
    return sample

ds_dockerfile = ds_dockerfile.map(preprocess_code)

## Augmenting the Dataset
To enhance the dataset, a static style field is added for tone tagging (e.g., formal or casual).

> Augmentation Code
def augment_with_tags(sample):
    sample['style'] = 'formal'
    return sample

ds_dockerfile = ds_dockerfile.map(augment_with_tags)

## Model Fine-Tuning

Using the preprocessed dataset, a pre-trained generative language model (e.g., GPT or T5) is fine-tuned.

Steps:
Load the preprocessed dataset.
Configure hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Save the fine-tuned model and evaluate it on sample inputs.
Tools:
Hugging Face's transformers library for model fine-tuning.
Application Development
The application is built using FastAPI, providing:

A query input box for user interaction.
Configurable settings like response tone or temperature.
Real-time responses powered by the fine-tuned model.
Features
Web Interface: User-friendly front-end for interaction.
Logging: Tracks and analyzes user queries and responses.
    
> Example Code
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the AI-powered Dockerfile Assistant!"}
    
## Deployment and Optimization
Steps:
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the Docker container to DigitalOcean for scalability.
Optimization: Ensure minimal latency and high availability.
